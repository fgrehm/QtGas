h1. QtGas

h2. Description

QtGas is a mobile application for tracking gas mileage and vehicle maintenance. It was inspired by "GasCubby":http://www.appcubby.com/gas/index.html for the iPhone OS and will target all "Qt framework":http://qt.nokia.com/ supported platforms.

h3. Installation

"Download":http://github.com/fgrehm/QtGas/downloads the package for your platform, unpack files and run the executable :-)

h3. Usage

When you run the applications for the first time you will be asked for car's current odometer, you should fill up your tank and then fill in the form. After that you can start adding fill up records!

If you want to clean up your data, just delete the 'storage' folder on the same path as the executable.

h3. Dependencies

* "Qt 4.7 Framework":http://qt.nokia.com/ compiled with "Declarative UI (QML)":http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/declarativeui.html support enabled
* "persistence.js":http://github.com/zefhemel/persistencejs

h2. Supported platforms

At the moment it was only tested on a Windows Mobile 6.5.3 WVGA phone (a hacked HTC Blackstone) and Maemo 5 under scratchbox and I've got plans to add support for Symbian in the future. Let me know if you are interested in trying it out on some other "non-official" platforms.

Please note that I'll target touchscreen devices first and later will work on adding support for non-touchscreen ones.
